# Statistics

### Project Objective
Create a series of Python and R scripts for boostrapping, hypothesis testing, bayesian testing. This is meant more for 
practice and pragmatic application of Python. I'll validate the results and approaches in R since I'm more comfortable
with the language. 

### Required Python Packages
* numpy
* pandas
* random
* dataclasses
* scipy.stats
* math
* bootstrapped

### Required R Libraries
* boot
